description: "Create handlers for our routes"
---

We've handled auth and tackled input validation. All of this work allows our route handlers to focus on one thing: Interacting with the DB without having to worry about anything else.
<br>
Time to roll up our sleeves and create all of the handlers for our remaining routes! Create a file for each resource in the `src/handlers` folder. Place every handler for that resource in the correct file. Just like we did for `src/handlers/user`, where `/user` is a resource.
