{"pageProps":{"post":{"attributes":{"description":"Migrating the DB"},"html":"<h2 id=\"migrations\">Migrations</h2>\n<p>Since this is our first time interacting with the DB, we need to run our initial migration to get the DB and our schema in sync. We&#39;ll continue to run migrations as we make schema changes to ensure the schema and any data in the DB stay in sync. Before we run a migration, we need to install the prisma client which is the SDK we&#39;ll use in our code to interact with the DB. This client is type-safe and based on of our schema. It&#39;s actually an NPM package that gets generated on demand to adjust to your schema! Pretty cool.\n<br>\n<code>npm i @prisma/client --save</code>\n<br>\nNext, lets migrate the DB. Make sure you added your DB connection string to the <code>.env</code> file as <code>DATABASE_URL</code>. You can find the connection string on render. Be sure to use the external one. Now to run the migration:\n<br>\n<code>npx prisma migrate dev --name init</code>\n<br>\nThis will migrate the DB over to use our schema and then generate the new client for us. This client will be used in our code and is now type-checked against our schema.</p>\n","slug":"first-migrations","title":"First Migrations","section":"Data Modeling","icon":"shapes","filePath":"/home/runner/work/API-design-v4/API-design-v4/lessons/05-data-modeling/C-first-migrations.md","nextSlug":"/API-design-v4/lessons/routes-and-middleware/creating-routes","prevSlug":"/API-design-v4/lessons/data-modeling/creating-models"}},"__N_SSG":true}
