{"pageProps":{"post":{"attributes":{},"html":"<h2 id=\"congrats\">Congrats</h2>\n<p>You made it! You now know what it feels like to build an API from scratch using Node.js. We&#39;ve covered a bunch of stuff, but there is still so much more to learn. I challenge you to build out API&#39;s for your projects vs reaching for the Backend as a Service instead. The more API&#39;s you build, the better you&#39;ll become.\n<br>\nThank you!</p>\n","slug":"next-steps","title":"Next Steps","section":"Deployment and Next Steps","icon":"info-circle","filePath":"/home/runner/work/API-design-v4/API-design-v4/lessons/13-deployment-and-next-steps/B-next-steps.md","nextSlug":null,"prevSlug":"/API-design-v4/lessons/deployment-and-next-steps/deploying"}},"__N_SSG":true}
