On a server that is shared by all your clients, this is really bad.\n<br>\nYour API could fail to take incoming request because it&#39;s blocked by CPU intensive work on the main thread. To avoid this, make sure any intense workload is asynchronous.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blocking-code\">Blocking code</h2>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of some code that would prevent your API from receiving more requests until its done.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-ts\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> fs <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;fs&quot;</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> result = fs.<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">readFileSync</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;some/path/to/file.txt&quot;</span>);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Reading a file with the sync version of the method is blocking. If that file was huge and running on a popular route where many requests triggered its execution, your API will eventually slow down. To avoid this, you&#39;d want to make sure this code was async.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-ts\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// promise version</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> fs <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;fs/promises&quot;</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> result = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">await</span> fs.<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">readFile</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;some/path/to/file.txt&quot;</span>);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, this code will no longer tie up the main thread, allowing more requests to come through. If you ABSOLUTELY could not convert some sync code to async code, then you should use a child process to run the code on a different thread.</p>\n","slug":"async-everything","title":"Async Everything","section":"Perf","icon":"tachometer-fast","filePath":"/home/runner/work/API-design-v4/API-design-v4/lessons/11-perf/A-async-everything.md","nextSlug":"/API-design-v4/lessons/testing/setting-up-test","prevSlug":"/API-design-v4/lessons/global-config/configs"}},"__N_SSG":true}
