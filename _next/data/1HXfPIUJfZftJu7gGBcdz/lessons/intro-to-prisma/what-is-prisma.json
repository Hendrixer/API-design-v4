For the most part, you&#39;ll end up with a Relational (SQL) DB or a NoSql DB (Document Store). We&#39;re not going to get into what is the &quot;best&quot; DB because that&#39;s impossible to answer and changes as your product&#39;s needs change.</p>\n<p>However, no matter the DB, how you interact with the DB matters. What good is the perfect DB that is painfull to interact with. Enter, and ORM. Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) is a term used to describe a technique that allows you to interact with a DB using an object-oriented approach. When most people say ORM, they&#39;re actually talking about an ORM library, which is really just and SDK for your DB. For example, without and ORM, you can only interact with a SQL DB using SQL.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-sql\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">INSERT</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">INTO</span> Customers (\n  CustomerName,\n  ContactName,\n  Address,\n  City,\n  PostalCode,\n  Country\n)\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">VALUES</span>\n  (<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;Cardinal&#x27;</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;Tom B.

It supports most DBs out there. It not only has an SDK for doing basic and advanced querying of a DB, but also handles schemas, migrations, seeding, and sophisticated writes. It&#39;s slowly but surely becoming the ORM of choice for Node.js projects.</p>\n","slug":"what-is-prisma","title":"What Prisma","section":"Intro to Prisma","icon":"database","filePath":"/home/runner/work/API-design-v4/API-design-v4/lessons/04-intro-to-prisma/A-what-is-prisma.md","nextSlug":"/API-design-v4/lessons/intro-to-prisma/db-setup","prevSlug":"/API-design-v4/lessons/intro-to-express/easy-mode-with-express"}},"__N_SSG":true}
